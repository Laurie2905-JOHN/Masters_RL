    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of generated preferences for n children. In a real-world context, such data could be gathered through questionnaires or feedback after meals. For this example, the data is synthesized based on multiple studies that explore factors influencing children's food preferences. Each child is assigned a score for each ingredient, derived from their individual characteristics, and a label indicating whether they like, are neutral towards, or dislike the ingredient. There is also a random element added. While the influence of these factors is not precisely accurate and would require refinement in a real-world setting, they serve as a foundational basis for analysis in this research. The function also splits the data, which will be used to determine if the feedback can predict the rest of the children's preferences.\n",

The comments discuss multiple ingredients, allowing us to evaluate whether the sentiment towards each ingredient can be accurately measured through relatively simple sentiment analysis. Additionally, they help monitor how satisfaction with the meal plan will evolve over time. In reality, the comments wouldn't be as perfectly structured as they are here, but this serves as a good starting point. Feedback is provided based on the known and unknown preferences of the child. These comments will then be used to update the known preference list. "

    "### Fairness Principles\n",
    "**Equity Principle**: We integrated the equity principle by considering the impact of a child's vote through the number of preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial method for weighting votes relied on the total number of preferences (likes, neutrals, and dislikes) each child expressed. This approach can unintentionally give more influence to children with a higher number of preferences. To ensure a fairer distribution of votes, we should adjust the weights of the votes more thoughtfully, considering both the type of preferences and the number of preferences each child has.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, votes will be normalized so that each child's dislike, neutral, and like votes have a similar impact. For example, if one child dislikes 20 ingredients while another child dislikes only 2, the child with fewer dislikes would have a disproportionately small dislike impact if the votes were not adjusted with a weighting factor. Therefore, it is prudent to make the impact of one child’s 20 dislikes more comparable to the impact of another child’s 2 dislikes, ensuring each child's preferences are equitably represented.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Need Principle**: \n",
    "+ Firstly, This principle is addressed by categorizing ingredients by type, ensuring that an ingredient from each group is chosen. \n",
    "+ Secondly, in the top 10% of the list no child will have all their disliked ingredients contained within. Otherwise, their basic needs will not be met, as they will continually receive items they dislike. This prevents any one child not meeting nutritional targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meritocracy Principle**\n",
    "\n",
    "+ To incorporate the principle of meritocracy, we must define actions that contribute to our collective goal: providing healthier, cheaper, and improved nutrition in school meals.\n",
    "+ The children help achieve this by reducing food waste and improving their preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to give merit to good actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Proportional Voting Weight**:\n",
    "   - The weight of a child's vote will be proportional to their like/dislike ratio. For example, if a child dislikes 10 ingredients but likes only 5, their vote will account for 50% less compared to a child who likes and dislikes an equal number of ingredients.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feedback Participation**:\n",
    "   - Children who actively participate in giving feedback on previous meals will have increased voting power. Conversely, those who do not provide feedback will have reduced voting power for their preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Merit Points for Good Behavior**:\n",
    "   - Children can earn merit points for positive behaviors such as reducing food waste. More merit points will translate to a more powerful vote.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transparency and Communication**\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The system must be transparent. Ensure that the criteria for earning merit points and the conversion of these points to voting power are clearly communicated and understood by all participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ By implementing these measures, we aim to create a fair and motivating environment that encourages children to contribute positively towards our collective goal of improving school meals.\n"
