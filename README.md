# AI-Based School Meal Optimisation System

## Overview

This project presents an AI-based system designed to optimise school meal planning by balancing nutrition, cost, environmental impact, and user satisfaction. While traditional school meal research programmes have shown improvements in nutrition and environmental impact, they often fail to adequately optimise meal satisfaction. This system introduces two AI techniques—**Reinforcement Learning** and **Genetic Algorithms**—to better adjust ingredient selection and quantities to meet various optimisation goals.

### Key Features:
- **AI-driven optimisation**: Utilises reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms to optimise meal planning.
- **Preference prediction**: Predicts ingredient preferences using a classification model based on research-driven features of both ingredients and students.
- **Fairness in decision-making**: Implements social choice and computational justice theory to ensure a fair aggregation of individual preferences into a collective decision.
- **Dynamic updates and feedback**: Allows for continuous improvement of meal plans based on user feedback and satisfaction data.

## Research-Based Software

This system was developed as part of a **research thesis** and primarily functions as a proof of concept. It has been tested in a controlled environment using **synthetic data**. As such, **it has not been validated in real-world school settings**.

### Important Considerations:
- **Not tested on other devices**: This system has only been tested in the development environment. Further validation is required for implementation across different platforms or devices.
- **No real-world data testing**: The system's performance with real-world data remains untested. Synthetic data was used for all current tests.
- **Further research needed**: Testing in actual school settings is essential to refine the model for practical application. Additionally, considering ingredient pairings will be important. Gathering more data is crucial for these improvements.

## Installation

To install and run the project, follow these steps:
