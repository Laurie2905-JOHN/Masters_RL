## Project Overview

This project aims to improve school meal programs by leveraging socially guided reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize for better nutrition, lower cost, and reduced environmental impact. By incorporating children's preferences, we aim to create a more acceptable and effective meal planning system.


## 2. Aims and Objectives

This research project aims to investigate the use of socially guided corrective reinforcement learning to refine meal planning, considering children’s preferences for more acceptable and effective school meal programs. To do this, a simulation with artificial children interacting with a school meal program will be developed. The food consumption of an artificial child will be determined by a profile developed from open-source surveys of children’s food preferences. A database of approximately 130 ingredients will be utilized by an RL (Reinforcement Learning) agent to make ingredient selections. The agent will receive feedback on its selections based on environmental, nutritional, cost, and child satisfaction metrics.

### 2.1 Aims

- Investigate the use of socially guided reinforcement learning as an optimization tool for selecting school meals.

### 2.2 Objectives

- Develop a simple simulation and database for simulating child interaction with a school meal.
- Test various forms of reinforcement learning algorithms.
- Analyse the data from the simulation to evaluate the performance of the reinforcement learning agent.
- Enhance the simulation and/or reinforcement learning through human corrective feedback.
- Investigate how this optimization method could be employed in the real world.
